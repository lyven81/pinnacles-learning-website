    <h2>🐔 Lunch Rush, No More Missed Orders</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">How one chicken rice stall reduced waste, avoided sell-outs, and served every customer — by trusting the numbers.</span></p>

    <p>This story comes from a humble chicken rice stall that serves the lunch crowd in a busy neighborhood. For years, they faced the same daily dilemma: prepare too much and waste food, or prepare too little and turn customers away. The lunch hour was their peak — but also the most unpredictable part of their day.</p>

    <p>They wanted to do better, but weren’t sure how.</p>

    <p>We began by looking at their daily sales data, especially for two key items: steamed chicken rice and barley drinks. What we found surprised them. While steamed chicken rice was clearly their bestseller, its demand fluctuated wildly — some days they sold 12 plates, other days nearly 25. Barley, on the other hand, had more stable demand, usually between 4 to 6 glasses a day.</p>

    <p>Using this information, we helped them forecast lunch demand more accurately. They started preparing 20–25 portions of chicken rice on weekdays, with a small buffer on Fridays and weekends, where demand typically spiked. For barley, they kept a consistent stock of 6–8 units, just enough to meet demand without overstocking.</p>

    <p>They also noticed something else — most customers spent between RM16 and RM30, with the average around RM23. So, they introduced meal bundles priced at RM25–30, combining a main dish and drink. This not only encouraged slightly higher spending but helped them plan their prep more efficiently.</p>

    <p>Thanks to these simple data insights, they saw:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>22% increase</strong> in average daily profit</li>
      <li>Fewer last-minute sell-outs</li>
      <li>Less food wasted at the end of the day</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      “We used to run out of chicken rice before 1 PM — now, we’re ready for the rush. Customers are happy, and we waste less.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>This isn’t just about spreadsheets. It’s about helping a small business serve every customer well, grow confidently, and breathe a little easier at the end of a busy day.</p>
