      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Most small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) rely on instinct when making key decisions — what to stock, which customers to focus on, or when to offer discounts. 
        At Pinnacles Holding Limited, we believe that your business can achieve better results by using data you already have.
      </p>
      <p>
        We built our membership analytics service with one goal in mind: to help business owners like you understand what’s really driving your sales and customer loyalty. 
        Instead of guessing, we give you simple, actionable insights to keep your customers coming back, avoid overstocking, and plan smarter promotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our approach is practical and focused on results. We don’t overwhelm you with technical jargon. 
        Instead, we transform raw data into clear strategies — whether it’s predicting which product will sell next week or finding out which customers are at risk of leaving.
