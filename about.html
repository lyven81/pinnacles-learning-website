      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Pinnacles Analytics helps small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make confident, data-backed decisions across operations, marketing, and customer management. 
        Instead of relying on guesswork, we turn your business data into clear, actionable dashboards and insights you can trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our services are designed specifically for business owners who want to understand their customer behavior, forecast inventory needs, optimize promotions, and improve sales performance — all without needing a technical background.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're running a retail shop, service business, or e-commerce store, we help you uncover trends, reduce waste, and make smarter daily decisions — using tools you're already familiar with, like Excel and Power BI.
