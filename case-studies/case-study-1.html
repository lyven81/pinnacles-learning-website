    <h1>Lunch Rush, No More Missed Orders</h1>
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What we found:</strong> Most sales happened between 11am–1pm, but stock was set equally across all days.</li>
        <li><strong>What it means:</strong> They were losing lunchtime revenue due to under-prep.</li>
        <li><strong>What to do:</strong> Adjust prep volume by weekday patterns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Business Context</h2>
    <p>This chicken rice stall often sold out before lunch peak hours. The owner suspected inconsistent demand, but wasn’t sure how much to prepare each day. Our goal was to uncover demand patterns to match supply with actual needs.</p>

    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <h3>Insight: Most Sales Happen Between 11am–1pm</h3>
    <p>Sales peaked during lunch, especially mid-week. Mondays were quiet, while Wednesdays and Fridays saw the highest demand.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Recommended Action:</strong> Increase prep on Wed/Fri, reduce on Mon.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Insight: Daily Demand Follows a Predictable Pattern</h3>
    <p>Over 3 weeks, daily sales totals were fairly consistent per weekday. This made forecasting and prep planning easier than expected.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Recommended Action:</strong> Create a prep guide based on weekly sales rhythm.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By using sales data to guide prep decisions, the stall avoided under- and over-prepping. They sold more meals, reduced waste, and gave better service during peak hours.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Review sales weekly to update prep guide</li>
        <li>Test slight changes in price or portion size to optimize revenue</li>
    </ul>
