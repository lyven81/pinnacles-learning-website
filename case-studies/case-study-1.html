      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>What we found:</strong> Most sales happened on weekdays between 11AM‚Äì1PM, but prep volumes were constant and missed real demand.</p>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> The stall often ran out of steam chicken rice early, missing revenue and disappointing customers.</p>
        <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Adjust preparation based on weekday demand patterns and bundle pricing to grow daily revenue.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="context">
      <h2>Business Context</h2>
      <p>This chicken rice stall often ran out of its best-selling dish before peak hours ended. The owner suspected food was underprepared and waste was high on slow days. The goal was to analyze real sales data and adjust stock and staffing accordingly ‚Äî without increasing costs.</p>
