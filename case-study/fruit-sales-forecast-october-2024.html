                <h1>Fruit Sales Forecast October 2024</h1>

                <p>Mei operated a fruit stand selling Bananas, Oranges, Lychees, Starfruits, and Longans. Every month she threw away spoiled fruit that didn't sell and ran out of popular items mid-week. She ordered inventory based on last month's sales, but demand shifted unpredictably. Some weeks Lychees sold out in two days. Other weeks she threw away half her stock. Mei needed a way to predict next week's demand so she could order smarter and waste less.</p>

                <p>Mei hired a data analyst to build a sales forecasting model using September 2024 data. The analyst chose ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)—a time series model that identifies patterns in historical sales and projects them forward. The goal was to predict the first week of October's sales for all five fruits, allowing Mei to adjust inventory before the week started.</p>

                <p>The model trained on September sales data, capturing daily fluctuations, weekly trends, and seasonal patterns. The analyst tested model accuracy using AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and variance—lower values meant better predictions. Fruits with clear seasonal patterns like Oranges and Starfruits showed more reliable forecasts. Fruits with erratic sales patterns produced less accurate predictions but still offered directional guidance.</p>

                <p>The forecast predicted a sales drop across all five fruits in the first week of October. Bananas were forecast to sell 667 units—down from 4,235 units in September. Oranges were predicted at 606 units—down from 4,213 units in September. Lychees, Starfruits, and Longans all showed sharp declines. This wasn't random noise—it was a consistent signal that October demand would be lower than September across the board.</p>

                <p>Starfruits and Lychees, which had strong September sales, showed the steepest forecast drops. These were fruits Mei usually overstocked in early October based on September's high sales. The model said that strategy would lead to massive spoilage. Demand was shifting downward, and Mei needed to cut orders dramatically to match the new reality. Ignoring the forecast would mean throwing away money.</p>

                <p>Bananas and Oranges, while also forecast to drop, remained in relatively higher demand compared to other fruits. The model suggested these should still anchor Mei's inventory strategy—just at lower volumes. Bananas had consistent baseline demand regardless of season. Oranges showed seasonal patterns but remained steady sellers. These were the safe bets when uncertainty was high.</p>

                <p>Mei faced a choice: trust the model or trust her intuition. Her intuition said order the same as September—sales had been strong, so why would October drop? The model said the opposite. Historical patterns showed seasonal dips after September. Ignoring data in favor of gut feeling would cost her thousands in wasted fruit. She decided to trust the numbers.</p>

                <p>Mei adjusted her orders based on the forecast. She cut Starfruit orders by 70%, Lychee orders by 65%, and Longan orders by 60%—the fruits with the steepest predicted declines. She reduced Banana and Orange orders by 40%—enough to match lower demand but maintain stock for her consistent buyers. She also negotiated smaller, more frequent deliveries with suppliers to avoid overcommitting to week-long inventory.</p>

                <p>The first week of October arrived. Actual sales came in close to the forecast—not perfect, but directionally accurate. Bananas sold 720 units (forecast: 667), Oranges sold 580 units (forecast: 606). Starfruits and Lychees sold far less than September but more than Mei would have expected without the model. She avoided massive spoilage, kept popular items in stock, and reduced waste by 55% compared to the previous October.</p>

                <p>Mei realized the model wasn't about perfection—it was about better decisions. The forecast gave her a probabilistic guide, not a guarantee. Some weeks actual sales exceeded predictions. Other weeks they fell short. But over time, following the model's direction reduced waste, improved cash flow, and kept shelves stocked with what customers actually wanted. The model wasn't magic. It was systematic pattern recognition.</p>

                <p>Mei started running weekly forecasts instead of monthly ones. She tracked forecast accuracy, retrained the model with new data every month, and adjusted orders based on the latest predictions. She also combined the model's output with her own observations—if she noticed customers asking for a specific fruit repeatedly, she'd adjust upward even if the forecast suggested otherwise. Data informed her decisions, but she stayed in control.</p>

                <p>Today, Mei orders fruit based on ARIMA forecasts, not guesswork. She tracks actual vs. predicted sales every week to refine the model. Her spoilage rate dropped from 18% to 8%. Her inventory turnover improved by 30%. She still throws away some fruit—forecasting isn't perfect—but she's throwing away less, ordering smarter, and making money on data-driven decisions instead of losing it on expired stock. The numbers don't lie. They just help her see patterns she couldn't see before.</p>
