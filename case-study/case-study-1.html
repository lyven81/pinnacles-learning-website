      <h2>How a Chicken Rice Stall Reduced Waste and Boosted Profits</h2>

      <p>This story comes from a small chicken rice stall that serves the weekday lunch crowd in a busy neighborhood. Every day, they faced the same struggle: if they prepared too much, they wasted food. If they prepared too little, they had to turn customers away. Lunch was their busiest time ‚Äî but also the hardest to predict.</p>

      <p>They didn‚Äôt know where to start, so we offered to help by looking at their daily sales. We focused on two items: steamed chicken rice and barley drinks. What we found surprised them. Chicken rice was the top seller, but the number sold each day jumped up and down ‚Äî sometimes just 12 plates, sometimes nearly 25. Barley drinks, on the other hand, were more stable ‚Äî usually 4 to 6 glasses a day.</p>

      <p>With that insight, they began prepping more confidently. On weekdays, they cooked 20‚Äì25 portions of chicken rice, with a little extra on Fridays when demand tended to spike. For barley, they kept a steady supply of 6‚Äì8 cups. This simple adjustment reduced waste and helped them serve more customers without running short.</p>

      <p>They also noticed that most customers spent around RM23. So, they introduced meal bundles priced at RM25‚Äì30, which encouraged slightly higher spending while helping them plan ahead. The result? They saw a <strong>22% increase in average daily profit</strong>, fewer last-minute sell-outs, and less food thrown away.</p>

      <blockquote>‚ÄúWe used to run out before 1 PM ‚Äî now, we‚Äôre ready. Customers are happy, and we waste less.‚Äù</blockquote>
