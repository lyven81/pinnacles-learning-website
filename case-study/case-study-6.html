  <h2>üçï Not All Bestsellers Stay Best</h2>
  <p><strong>How a pizza shop used daily sales data to refresh their promos, focus their stock, and avoid pushing the wrong pies.</strong></p>

  <p>This story comes from a neighborhood pizza shop known for its wide variety ‚Äî from classic Hawaiian to bold Thai Chicken. Business was stable, but the team began to notice something odd:</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúSome of our bestsellers weren‚Äôt selling like they used to.‚Äù
  </blockquote>

  <p>They had no way of knowing if customer tastes had shifted or if their promotions were simply outdated. So, we worked with them to dive into their daily sales patterns, helping them spot which pizzas were truly performing ‚Äî and when.</p>

  <p>What we found was simple, but powerful.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Large-sized Chicken and Veggie pizzas brought in the most revenue. The Thai Chicken Pizza alone earned over RM11,600, followed closely by The Five Cheese and Four Cheese Pizzas.</li>
    <li>But not all top-selling items stayed fast-moving. Some high-revenue pizzas were slowing down, quietly slipping behind others.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We helped them sort pizzas into two lists: fast movers and slow movers. Some names surprised them. The Big Meat Pizza, while popular, was losing steam. Others like Spicy Italian and Hawaiian were still flying out the door.</p>

  <p>Timing also mattered. Lunchtime between 12 PM‚Äì1 PM and dinner around 5 PM‚Äì6 PM were peak hours ‚Äî especially on weekdays. But their promotions and staff schedules weren‚Äôt always aligned with these windows.</p>

  <p>Using this data, they made a few key changes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Refocused their promotions on pizzas that were both popular and profitable, like the Five Cheese and Spicy Italian</li>
    <li>Adjusted staff shifts to cover weekday lunch and dinner rush more effectively</li>
    <li>Reduced stock and marketing for pizzas that looked good on paper but weren‚Äôt moving fast enough</li>
  </ul>

  <p>They also started checking weekly forecasts to plan stock and labor more flexibly. For instance, if next week‚Äôs revenue was expected around RM6,500, they‚Äôd prepare just enough of the right items ‚Äî avoiding both waste and stock-outs.</p>

  <p>The result?</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Better margins without changing menu prices</li>
    <li>Less unsold pizza at closing</li>
    <li>Happier customers getting their favorites ‚Äî when they want them most</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúWe used to push the same items over and over. Now, we push what people actually want ‚Äî and it shows.‚Äù
  </blockquote>

  <p>Not every bestseller stays one forever. But with the right data, this pizza shop knew when to adapt ‚Äî and that made all the difference.</p>
