                <h1>Connected or Disconnected</h1>

                <p>Angela was a high school counselor who heard the same worry from parents and teachers every week: social media is ruining kids' relationships. Some blamed Instagram for creating shallow friendships. Others said messaging apps helped students stay close. Angela didn't know who was right. She needed data to understand whether social media actually hurt or helped her students' real-life relationships—and which students were most at risk.</p>

                <p>Angela worked with a data analyst to survey students about their social media habits and relationship quality. They asked how many hours students spent online daily, which platforms they used, where they lived (urban, suburban, rural), and whether they felt their relationships improved, stayed the same, or worsened. The goal was to find patterns—not to prove social media was good or bad, but to identify when and for whom it became a problem.</p>

                <p>The overall correlation between social media time and relationship quality was weak—just 0.1244. That meant screen time alone didn't predict whether relationships got better or worse. Some heavy users reported stronger friendships. Others felt more isolated. The wide variation suggested that how students used social media mattered far more than how long they used it. Time spent wasn't the issue. Purpose and platform were.</p>

                <p>Angela looked at heavy users—students spending 5+ hours daily. Among them, 40% said their relationships improved, 33% saw no change, and 27% felt worse. Moderate users (3 hours daily) were evenly split: roughly one-third improved, one-third unchanged, one-third worse. The data showed that heavy use could go either way. It wasn't inherently harmful or helpful. Context determined the outcome.</p>

                <p>Living environment changed everything. Urban students showed the strongest positive correlation (0.2375)—social media seemed to help them maintain connections in busy, fragmented schedules. Rural students showed a weak positive correlation (0.0861)—digital tools helped bridge geographic distance. Suburban students showed a negative correlation (-0.1667)—social media seemed to replace, not supplement, face-to-face interaction. Angela realized suburban students needed the most guidance.</p>

                <p>Students using 3-5 hours daily were the highest risk group. Among them, only 16.67% reported improved relationships, while 38.89% felt worse—the most negative outcome of any usage level. This was the danger zone. Below 3 hours, outcomes were balanced. Above 5 hours, some students found value but many didn't. The 3-5 hour range consistently delivered the worst results. That's where Angela needed to focus interventions.</p>

                <p>Among the 6 heavy users who reported improved relationships, 4 preferred Facebook and 5 used WhatsApp daily. These students weren't passive scrollers—they used social media for direct, meaningful communication. Most lived in urban (3) or rural (2) areas where digital connection filled real gaps. The pattern was clear: purposeful messaging apps beat passive social feeds. Communication beats consumption.</p>

                <p>Overall, only 30.61% of students said social media improved their relationships. Even among heavy users, the rate rose to just 42.86%—still a minority. Most students didn't benefit, and many were harmed. The data contradicted the idea that more time online automatically meant better connections. More time meant more risk unless paired with intentional communication habits.</p>

                <p>On the other side, 34.69% of all students reported worsened relationships due to social media. Heavy users faced a 35.71% worsening rate—slightly higher than average. But only 29.41% of students who felt harmed were heavy users, meaning moderate users were also at risk. Angela couldn't just target the most extreme cases. Even 2-3 hours daily could damage relationships if used poorly.</p>

                <p>The students most at risk shared common patterns: 3-5 hours daily, heavy WhatsApp use, living in urban or rural areas, and—most alarmingly—14 out of 17 also reported negative mental health impacts. These were the early warning signs Angela started watching for: prolonged screen time in the danger zone, frequent messaging app use, and emotional withdrawal from face-to-face relationships. If she caught these patterns early, she could intervene before damage deepened.</p>

                <p>Angela created targeted programs based on the data. For suburban students, she ran workshops on balancing digital and in-person interaction—emphasizing that online time shouldn't replace real-world connection. For urban and rural students, she focused on using social media purposefully: messaging friends directly instead of scrolling feeds, joining group chats that fostered real conversation, and recognizing when digital interaction became a substitute for emotional engagement. She also flagged students in the 3-5 hour daily range for check-ins.</p>

                <p>Today, Angela doesn't tell students to quit social media or limit screen time arbitrarily. She teaches them to recognize whether their digital habits strengthen or weaken their relationships. She uses data to identify high-risk patterns early and offers support before students withdraw completely. The question isn't whether social media is good or bad—it's whether each student is using it in ways that help or hurt their real-life connections. Angela's job is to teach them the difference.</p>
