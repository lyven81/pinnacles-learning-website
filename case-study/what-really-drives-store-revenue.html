                <h1>What Really Drives Store Revenue?</h1>

                <p>Sarah managed a hypermarket with hundreds of product categories spread across thousands of square meters. Every quarter, she faced the same question from headquarters: where should we invest our budget? More shelf space for electronics? Bigger promotions for clothing? Better deals from food suppliers? She was making million-ringgit decisions based on gut feeling, and it showed in her inconsistent results.</p>

                <p>Sarah hired a data analyst to find out which product subcategories actually drove her store's revenue. The analyst studied 85 weeks of sales data, looking at how different subcategories like Footwear, Sportswear, Women's Wear, and Home Appliances affected total weekly revenue. The goal was simple: stop guessing and start knowing where every promotional ringgit would have the most impact.</p>

                <p>The analyst built a regression model that explained 99.5% of revenue variation. The model tested nine subcategories plus a time trend. It revealed something Sarah never expected: Wearable Accessories alone accounted for 37% of total revenue influence. This single subcategory—watches, jewelry, bags—had more impact than any other category in her entire store.</p>

                <p>The next tier was clearer too. Sportswear and Footwear together explained 30% of revenue impact. These weren't surprises—Sarah knew clothing was important—but she didn't realize Accessories dominated by such a large margin. Everything else—Home Appliances, Kids Wear, Women's Wear, Laptops, TVs, and Storage—contributed moderately or barely at all.</p>

                <p>The analyst showed Sarah what would happen if sales increased by 10% in each subcategory. Wearable Accessories delivered the biggest lift: +0.52 units of total revenue. Sportswear added +0.21 units. Home Appliances added +0.12 units. But here's what surprised Sarah most: boosting Footwear sales actually reduced total revenue by -0.20 units. Footwear was cannibalizing sales from more profitable categories.</p>

                <p>Sarah looked at the seasonal patterns next. Her revenue peaked sharply every Q4 during holiday shopping, then crashed in Q1. Laptops and Women's Wear amplified these holiday spikes—they sold heavily during peak season but contributed little the rest of the year. Sportswear, in contrast, delivered steady sales all year round. Sarah realized she needed both types: seasonal amplifiers for peak times and steady performers for baseline revenue.</p>

                <p>The forecast showed stable revenue of 1.35 million ringgit per week on average. The projection was flat because the model captured average subcategory effects, not seasonal surges. Sarah understood this was her baseline—a conservative number for budgeting. Actual results would exceed this during holidays and promotions, but the baseline gave her a planning floor she could count on.</p>

                <p>Sarah tested scenario simulations. She asked: what if we boost one category by 10%? What if we boost all categories together? The data showed that broad-based promotions across multiple subcategories delivered bigger gains than focusing on any single category alone. Even Wearable Accessories, as dominant as it was, couldn't carry the store by itself. Coordinated action worked better.</p>

                <p>Sarah redesigned her store strategy around these findings. Wearable Accessories got prime shelf space, premium floor positions, and priority in supplier negotiations. She ensured this category never ran out of stock during high-demand periods. Sportswear got consistent year-round promotions to maintain baseline revenue. Laptops and Women's Wear received heavy marketing only during Q4, when they actually mattered.</p>

                <p>She stopped wasting budget on low-impact categories. Kids Wear showed almost no marginal impact, so she reduced its shelf space and reallocated it to Accessories and Sportswear. She managed Footwear carefully, pricing it to avoid cannibalizing more profitable clothing sales. She timed her supplier negotiations to secure better deals for the high-impact subcategories that actually moved revenue.</p>

                <p>Sarah also coordinated her promotions differently. Instead of single-category sales, she bundled Sportswear with Accessories, or Laptops with Home Appliances during holidays. The scenario data showed these coordinated campaigns delivered cumulative gains. She allocated budget based on marginal impact—categories that generated +0.50 units got more investment than categories generating +0.05 units.</p>

                <p>Today, Sarah's budget decisions are data-driven. She knows Wearable Accessories is her anchor category. She knows Sportswear stabilizes revenue year-round. She knows Footwear needs careful handling. She knows when to push Laptops and when to hold back on Kids Wear. Her quarterly reports now show consistent growth instead of random swings. The guesswork is gone—she allocates resources where they actually work.</p>
