                <h1>Did You Sleep Well Last Night?</h1>

                <p>Jennifer managed a boutique hotel competing against larger chains. Guest reviews were good, but she noticed recurring complaints about sleep quality—noisy rooms, uncomfortable pillows, poor blackout curtains. She'd invested in a Wellness Suite with premium mattresses, aromatherapy, and blackout systems, but had no data proving it actually worked. Her board wanted evidence before approving similar upgrades across other room types. Jennifer needed sleep quality data to justify wellness investments.</p>

                <p>Jennifer partnered with a data analyst to launch an opt-in sleep tracking program. Guests who agreed received sleep tracking pads under their mattresses and got discounts on future stays. Over several months, 250 guests participated. The analyst tracked daily Sleep Scores—a metric measuring sleep duration, restfulness, and interruptions. The goal was simple: determine what percentage of guests achieved high-quality sleep (score ≥85) and whether the Wellness Suite actually delivered better results.</p>

                <p>The data showed 55.2% of guests achieved a Sleep Score of 85 or higher. That meant more than half experienced quality sleep, but 44.8% fell short. Jennifer's hotel was doing well for many guests, but nearly half weren't getting the restorative sleep she promised in her marketing. This wasn't a failure—it was a roadmap showing exactly where improvements would matter most.</p>

                <p>The Wellness Suite proved its worth. It averaged a Sleep Score of 87.8—higher than any other room type. Regular Suites came close at 87.7, but Standard, Deluxe, and Executive rooms all scored below 85. The Wellness Suite's premium features—adjustable lighting, aromatherapy diffusers, blackout curtains, and high-end mattresses—weren't just marketing gimmicks. They measurably improved guest sleep quality.</p>

                <p>Jennifer now had the data to answer her board's question: Does investing in sleep-focused amenities work? Yes. Guests in the Wellness Suite slept better than guests in any other room. The $15,000 per-room investment in upgraded amenities translated directly into higher Sleep Scores. The question wasn't whether wellness features worked—it was whether other rooms could justify similar upgrades.</p>

                <p>The overall average Sleep Score was 84.3, with a 95% confidence interval from 83.56 to 85.03. This meant Jennifer could be 95% confident the true average for all potential guests fell within that narrow range. The data wasn't a fluke. It was reliable. She could use these results to make decisions about room upgrades, pricing, and marketing without worrying about sampling error distorting the picture.</p>

                <p>The analyst explained sample size and margin of error. With 250 guests, the margin was reasonably tight. But for future studies, 95 guests would give a ±10% margin, 380 guests would reduce it to ±5%, and 9,500 guests would narrow it to ±1%. Jennifer didn't need perfect precision—she needed actionable confidence. A sample of 400 guests would hit the sweet spot: precise enough to guide major investments without requiring years of data collection.</p>

                <p>Jennifer looked at the 44.8% who scored below 85. What was holding them back? The data didn't explain why, but guest feedback did. Common complaints: pillows too soft or too firm, noise from hallways or neighboring rooms, lights from electronics disrupting sleep, room temperature control issues. These weren't exotic problems requiring cutting-edge technology. They were fixable with better pillows, soundproofing, blackout solutions, and smarter HVAC controls.</p>

                <p>Jennifer pitched a phased upgrade plan to her board. Phase 1: Upgrade Standard and Deluxe rooms with mid-tier versions of Wellness Suite features—adjustable pillows, improved blackout curtains, and white noise machines. Cost: $5,000 per room. Target: raise average Sleep Scores above 85. Phase 2: Expand full Wellness Suite features to Executive rooms if Phase 1 proved successful. Phase 3: Use sleep data as a marketing differentiator—position the hotel as a wellness destination backed by measurable sleep quality results.</p>

                <p>The board approved Phase 1. Jennifer rolled out upgrades to 30 rooms and tracked Sleep Scores for six months. Average scores rose from 83.2 to 86.1—above the 85 threshold. Guests noticed. Reviews mentioning "best sleep I've had in a hotel" increased by 40%. Repeat bookings for upgraded rooms outpaced non-upgraded rooms by 25%. The $150,000 investment paid for itself in eight months through higher occupancy and premium pricing.</p>

                <p>Jennifer learned that wellness isn't a luxury—it's measurable value. Guests will pay more for rooms that deliver better sleep, but only if the hotel can prove it works. The Wellness Suite became her flagship offering, marketed specifically to business travelers and health-conscious guests who valued sleep quality over room size or amenities. She raised nightly rates by 20% and still saw higher occupancy than standard rooms.</p>

                <p>Today, Jennifer uses sleep data to guide every room investment. She tracks Sleep Scores quarterly, tests new amenities in pilot rooms before full rollout, and uses confidence intervals to avoid overreacting to short-term fluctuations. Her hotel isn't the biggest or the fanciest, but it's the one where guests sleep best—and she has the data to prove it. Her competitors talk about wellness. Jennifer measures it.</p>
