                <h1>Boost Sales and Restocking Efficiency</h1>

                <p>Carlos operated 12 coffee vending machines across office buildings. Sales were decent, but he restocked on a fixed schedule—every machine, every other day, same inventory levels. He was wasting money on products that didn't sell and running out of popular items too early. His machines offered 15 drink options, but he had no idea which drinks sold when. He needed data to optimize restocking and maximize revenue per machine.</p>

                <p>Carlos hired a data analyst to study sales patterns by time of day. The analyst divided the day into morning (6am-12pm), afternoon (12pm-6pm), and evening (6pm-10pm) and tracked revenue, transaction volume, and drink preferences for each period. The goal was to identify when customers bought most and what they bought, so Carlos could restock smarter.</p>

                <p>The data showed afternoon was king. Afternoon generated $50,108 in revenue—the highest of any time block. Morning brought in $39,106, and evening $33,107. Afternoon was prime time for volume-based promotions and heavy restocking. Morning had fewer transactions but higher average order value, meaning customers bought premium drinks. Evening was the slowest period overall.</p>

                <p>Drink preferences shifted by time. In the morning, Americano dominated with 350 sales, followed by an Americano variant (232) and Café Latte (145). Customers wanted strong, straightforward coffee to start the day. In the afternoon, Latte took the lead with 335 sales, Americano dropped to second (313), and Café Latte came third (213). Afternoon buyers preferred creamier, milder drinks. Evening followed the afternoon pattern: Latte (233), Americano (205), Café Latte (172).</p>

                <p>Some drinks barely sold at all. Irish whiskey, chocolate, mocha chip, caramel with chocolate, and double latte had very low frequencies across all time periods—especially in the evening. These drinks were taking up machine space and inventory dollars without delivering returns. Carlos needed to decide: promote them heavily, reformulate them, or cut them entirely.</p>

                <p>Carlos changed his restocking strategy. For morning, he loaded machines heavily with Americano and Americano variants—the proven bestsellers. For afternoon and evening, he shifted the mix toward Lattes and Café Lattes, which dominated those periods. He stopped restocking all 15 drinks equally and started matching inventory to actual demand patterns.</p>

                <p>He cut inventory on underperformers. Irish whiskey, chocolate, and double latte got reduced to minimal stock levels. If they didn't start selling within two weeks, he'd remove them completely and free up space for drinks people actually wanted. Mocha chip and caramel with chocolate got one last chance—limited-time promotion during the slowest evening hours to test if marketing could revive them.</p>

                <p>Carlos introduced time-specific promotions. "Morning Espresso Kick"—discounted Americano from 6am-10am to capture the early rush. "Latte Lounge Hour"—afternoon combo deals (Latte + snack) from 12pm-3pm when volume was highest. "Smooth Latte Wind-Down"—evening promotion for lighter drinks from 6pm-8pm to boost the slowest period.</p>

                <p>He adjusted his restocking schedule. High-traffic afternoon locations got restocked twice daily to avoid sellouts of Latte and Café Latte. Low-traffic evening-only machines got restocked every three days instead of two, reducing unnecessary trips and labor costs. Morning-heavy offices got extra Americano stock but fewer specialty drinks that didn't move.</p>

                <p>Carlos tracked results for three months. Afternoon revenue climbed to $55,000 as he matched supply to demand and ran targeted promotions. Morning sales stayed stable but required less restocking effort. Evening improved slightly but remained the weakest period. Total revenue per machine increased 18%, and he cut restocking costs by 22% through smarter inventory management.</p>

                <p>The underperformers failed the test. Irish whiskey and double latte sold almost nothing even with promotions. Carlos removed them completely. Mocha chip showed a small uptick during evening promotions and stayed in the lineup. Caramel with chocolate got cut. He freed up four drink slots and replaced them with popular variants of Latte and Americano that sold immediately.</p>

                <p>Today, Carlos restocks based on data, not guesswork. Each machine has a custom profile—morning-heavy offices get Americano-focused inventory, afternoon-heavy locations stock Lattes. He runs time-specific promotions that match proven demand patterns. His machines are rarely empty of bestsellers and rarely overstocked with slow movers. Revenue is up, costs are down, and he's expanding to 20 machines using the same data-driven approach.</p>
