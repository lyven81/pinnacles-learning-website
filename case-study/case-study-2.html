      <h2> From Americano Mornings to Latte Nights</h2>
      <p><strong>How one café used sales patterns to restock smartly, reduce waste, and sell more croissants — without guessing.</strong></p>

      <p>This story comes from a small but popular café tucked in a corporate district, known for its croissants and smooth coffees. Business was steady, but they often wondered — Are we baking the right amount? Are we losing sales because we run out too early? Are we over-preparing when nobody’s buying?</p>

      <p>They had no idea.</p>

      <p>We stepped in to help them make sense of their daily sales. We started with croissants — the flaky, buttery favorite that customers loved but didn’t always buy. What we found was enlightening: about 28% of customers chose a croissant, and this number peaked on Mondays and early weekdays, not the weekends as they had assumed.</p>

      <p>They used to prep more pastries for the weekend crowd, expecting a spike. But the data told a different story — Monday was their true croissant day, perhaps because customers were easing into the week or treating themselves before diving into work.</p>

      <p>We also noticed that most croissant buyers didn’t necessarily pair them with the café’s signature angbutter, or even caffe lattes. These were independent choices, not guaranteed pairings. So instead of forcing fixed combos, we helped them offer flexible add-ons — letting customers build their own set (like a latte + optional croissant) at a small discount.</p>

      <p>They began running weekday specials — “Start Your Week with a Croissant” — and adjusted their prep schedule. Now, they bake more on Mondays and taper off slightly by the weekend, aligning with actual demand.</p>

      <p>The result?</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Less leftover stock at closing time</li>
        <li>Steadier weekday sales</li>
        <li>Better pairing options without forcing bundles</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>“We used to guess when to bake and what to pair. Now, we prep just enough — and sell more because of it.”</blockquote>

      <p>With just a few weeks of sales data, they turned uncertainty into rhythm. They no longer stock based on gut feeling — they stock with confidence.</p>
