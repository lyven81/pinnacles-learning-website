  <h2> More Sales, Same Budget</h2>
  <p><strong>How one business used data to stop wasting ad spend — and made every ringgit count.</strong></p>

  <p>This is the story of a business that was doing everything “right” — running ads on social media, putting up billboards, working with affiliates — yet still felt unsure. Sales were coming in, but they had one big question:</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Where should we actually be putting our money?”
  </blockquote>

  <p>They weren’t alone. Many small businesses juggle limited marketing budgets and are left guessing which channel truly works. So we helped them do something different — we let the numbers answer that question.</p>

  <p>We gathered campaign data from three main channels: affiliate marketing, billboards, and social media. Then we ran the numbers to find out — for every ringgit spent, how many product sales did each channel bring in?</p>

  <p>The results were eye-opening:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Affiliate Marketing delivered the highest return: every RM1 spent brought in almost 4 units sold.</li>
    <li>Billboards came next, returning 3 units per ringgit.</li>
    <li>Social Media followed closely, with around 2.4 units per ringgit.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The business had been spreading their budget fairly evenly across all platforms. But with this insight, they shifted more budget to affiliate marketing, maintained moderate billboard exposure, and used social media more strategically — for reach rather than conversions.</p>

  <p>They also used the model to simulate what would happen if they increased spending in each channel. A 50% boost in affiliate marketing alone could lift sales by nearly 8,000 units — all without increasing the total ad budget across the board.</p>

  <p>Thanks to this clarity, the business saw:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Higher return on the same marketing spend</li>
    <li>Better control over campaign outcomes</li>
    <li>Less reliance on guesswork and trial-and-error</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    “We didn’t need a bigger budget — we just needed to know where it works hardest.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>Today, they make every ad ringgit work smarter. And more importantly, they no longer feel like they’re shooting in the dark.</p>
