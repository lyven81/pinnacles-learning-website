                <h1>Trend or Trap</h1>

                <p>Sarah was a retail investor who'd held Google stock for five years. She'd watched it climb steadily, then crash in 2022, then surge again in 2023. Every time the price jumped 5% in a day, financial news called it a breakout. Every time it dropped 5%, they called it a collapse. Sarah didn't know what was normal anymore. Was a 5% daily swing a buying opportunity or a warning sign? She needed data to separate noise from signal, trends from traps.</p>

                <p>Sarah hired a data analyst to examine Google's historical price movements from 2004 to 2024. The analyst calculated daily and monthly percent changes, tracked 20-day and 200-day moving averages, and measured volatility across bull and bear markets. The goal was to define what "normal" looked like—so Sarah could recognize when movements were actually unusual and worth acting on.</p>

                <p>Daily price changes typically fell between –2% and +2%. Monthly changes usually ranged from –8% to +12%. Anything beyond these limits was unusual and potentially significant. Most days, Google moved less than 2% in either direction. Most months, it stayed within a 20% range. These weren't guarantees—just probabilities. Knowing the typical range helped Sarah avoid overreacting to ordinary fluctuations.</p>

                <p>The analyst found extreme outliers in 2022-2023—monthly changes exceeding 2700%. These weren't market movements. They were data anomalies, likely from stock splits or calculation errors. Sarah learned an important lesson: always verify extreme numbers before making decisions. Not everything that looks dramatic is real. Sometimes the data itself is wrong.</p>

                <p>The analyst tracked moving average crossovers—when the 20-day average crossed above or below the 200-day average. A Golden Cross (20-day crossing above 200-day) often signaled potential uptrends. A Death Cross (20-day crossing below 200-day) often preceded downturns. In 2012, a Golden Cross appeared before a multi-year rally. In 2022, a Death Cross preceded a steep decline. These signals weren't perfect, but they identified moments when short-term momentum shifted relative to long-term trends.</p>

                <p>From 2004 to early 2020, short-term price swings stayed close to long-term trends—deviations rarely exceeded 100 points. After 2020, extreme deviations occurred. In 2022, the gap between short- and long-term averages reached +1062 points. By 2023, it dropped to –1663 points. These massive swings suggested temporary market overreactions, not lasting shifts. Sarah realized post-2020 behavior was abnormal—using pre-2020 patterns as her baseline made more sense.</p>

                <p>The analyst tried to measure recovery time after sharp drops—how long it took the stock to regain its previous price after falling 5% or more in a single day. The analysis flagged 546 sharp drops but showed zero-day recovery for all of them—an impossible result. The calculation was flawed, likely comparing prices on the same day instead of tracking recovery over weeks or months. Sarah noted this as a reminder: not every analysis works. Sometimes the method itself fails, and you have to try a different approach.</p>

                <p>Seasonal patterns emerged. Quarterly volatility stayed within 20%–60% from 2004 to 2021. In early 2022, it spiked above 1100%—a clear anomaly tied to market-wide shocks or data distortions. On a monthly basis, volatility peaked in April, May, February, and September—months coinciding with earnings season when new information caused price swings. January showed the lowest volatility, suggesting it was the calmest month for holding positions.</p>

                <p>Bull vs. bear market performance showed stark differences. In bull markets, Google returned an average of +3.32% per month with lower volatility (72%). In bear markets, it returned –3.17% per month with higher volatility (150%). Bull markets rewarded patience. Bear markets punished it. Sarah realized she needed different strategies depending on market phase: hold and ride trends in bull markets, tighten stop-losses and reduce exposure in bear markets.</p>

                <p>Sarah applied the insights to her current holdings. Google was up 8% for the month—within the typical range, not unusual. The 20-day moving average was above the 200-day (a Golden Cross), suggesting short-term momentum favored bulls. Volatility was elevated but not extreme. Sarah decided to hold her position but set a stop-loss at 5% below her entry price to protect against sudden reversals. She wasn't chasing breakouts or panicking at drops. She was managing risk based on historical patterns.</p>

                <p>Sarah also learned what not to do: Don't assume every 5% move means something. Don't trust signals without verifying data quality. Don't use recent extreme volatility as a baseline for normal behavior. And most importantly, don't make decisions based on headlines. Headlines called every 3% move a breakout or collapse. The data said 3% moves were ordinary. Sarah stopped reading financial news and started reading charts.</p>

                <p>Today, Sarah invests with context. She knows what's normal for Google stock and what's not. She uses moving averages to identify momentum shifts, volatility patterns to adjust position size, and historical ranges to set realistic expectations. She doesn't predict the future—she just knows when current behavior deviates from past patterns enough to warrant action. The data doesn't tell her what to do. It just tells her when something unusual is happening. And in investing, that's often enough.</p>
