      <h2> Saving the Silent Spenders</h2>
      <p><strong>How a coffee vending machine business spotted its most valuable customers slipping away — and brought them back before it was too late.</strong></p>

      <p>This story comes from a growing coffee vending machine business spread across offices and campuses. Their drinks were a daily routine for many — a quick pick-me-up between meetings, study breaks, or late-night work sessions. But something was bothering them: sales were steady, but not growing. And loyal customers seemed to vanish without warning.</p>

      <p>We took a closer look at their sales data — not just who was buying, but who stopped.</p>

      <p>It turned out, they had a handful of customers whose purchases added up to thousands of ringgit over time. The highest-value customer had spent over RM3,600. These weren't just casual buyers — they were the quiet champions of the business.</p>

      <p>But here’s the catch: some of them hadn’t made a purchase in weeks.</p>

      <p>That’s when we identified the “silent spenders” — high-value customers who were quietly slipping away. Using churn prediction techniques and lifetime value estimates, we pinpointed the ones at risk of leaving and triggered gentle, personalized actions to win them back. These weren’t flashy promotions — just small nudges: a voucher, a thank-you message, or a limited-time offer tied to their favorite drink.</p>

      <p>The response was immediate. Several returned the same week. Some began buying even more regularly than before. They felt seen — and that made all the difference.</p>

      <p>We also found customers who bought coffee frequently, but only spent a small amount each time. Instead of ignoring them, we offered custom combos to encourage slightly higher spending — think “2 drinks for RM9 before 11 AM” or “add a snack for RM1.”</p>

      <p>Thanks to these simple changes, the business saw:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Reactivation of 3 out of 5 top silent spenders</li>
        <li>An 18% boost in average transaction value from low-spend regulars</li>
        <li>Better stock planning for popular drinks tied to loyal customer habits</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>“We had no idea we were losing our best customers… until the data showed us. Now, we check in before they disappear.”</blockquote>

      <p>Sometimes, it’s not about finding new customers — it’s about not losing the ones you already have. Especially the ones who never complain, never ask — but simply stop showing up.</p>

      <p>And with a little help from data, this business was able to keep the trust of its most valuable fans.</p>
